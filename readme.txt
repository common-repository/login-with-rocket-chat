A grant is a method of acquiring an access token. Deciding which grants to implement depends on the type of client the end user will be using, and the experience you want for your users.

= We support following grants: =

* Authorization code grant: This code grant is used when there is a need to access the protected resources on behalf of another third party application.

* Implicit grant: This grant relies on resource owner and registration of redirect uri. In authorization code grant user needs to ask for authorization and access token each time, but here access token is granted for a particular redirect uri provided by client using a particular browser.

* Client credential grant: This grant type heads towards specific clients, where access token is obtained by client by only providing client credentials. This grant type is quiet confidential.

* Resource owner password credentials grant: This type of grant is used where resource owner has trust relationship with the client. Just by using username and password, provided by resource owner authorization and authentication can be achieve

* Refresh token grant: Access tokens obtained in OAuth flow eventually expire. In this grant type client can refresh his or her access token.
